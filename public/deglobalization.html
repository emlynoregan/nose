                <h2>About this topic</h2>
                <p>
                    For decades, the trend was clear: falling trade barriers, lengthening supply chains, 
                    and deepening economic interdependence. That era appears to be ending. Trade wars, 
                    pandemic disruptions, and great power competition are fragmenting the global economy.

                    This section explores what deglobalization actually looks like, who's driving it, and 
                    what comes next. Is this a temporary disruption or a fundamental shift? What does 
                    "friendshoring" and "nearshoring" mean in practice? How will different regions adapt 
                    to a more fragmented world economy?
                </p>

                <h2>Key questions I'm exploring</h2>
                <p>
                    How far will deglobalization go? Which industries and countries are most exposed? 
                    What are the inflationary implications of shorter, more resilient supply chains? 
                    Could we see the emergence of distinct economic blocs, and what would that mean 
                    for global development?
                </p>
