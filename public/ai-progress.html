                <p>
                    We're living through an unprecedented acceleration in artificial intelligence capabilities. 
                    Large language models, image generators, and autonomous agents are transforming how we work, 
                    create, and think about what makes us human.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This section explores the technical progress being made, the economic disruption underway, 
                    and the philosophical questions raised by increasingly capable AI systems. I'll be making 
                    predictions about timelines, analyzing breakthrough papers, and examining what it all means 
                    for the future of knowledge work.
                </p>

                <h2>Key questions I'm exploring</h2>
                <p>
                    How fast is AI actually progressing? What jobs will be affected first, and which might be 
                    surprisingly resilient? Are we on track toward artificial general intelligence, and what 
                    would that actually mean? How should individuals and organizations adapt?
                </p>
