                <h2>About this topic</h2>
                <p>
                    The world's energy system is undergoing its most significant transformation since the 
                    industrial revolution. Solar and wind costs have plummeted, battery technology is 
                    advancing rapidly, and the electrification of transport is accelerating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the transition isn't simple. Grid stability, mineral supply chains, stranded assets, 
                    and political resistance create complex dynamics. This section examines the technology, 
                    economics, and politics of moving beyond fossil fuels—and what it means for different 
                    countries, industries, and investors.
                </p>

                <h2>Key questions I'm exploring</h2>
                <p>
                    How fast can renewables actually scale? What happens to petrostates as oil demand peaks? 
                    Which technologies will win the storage wars? How will the transition reshape global 
                    power dynamics, and who stands to gain or lose?
                </p>
